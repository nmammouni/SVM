
In our "Boston Housing Market Analysis with SVM" project, we explored the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the Boston housing dataset in order to predict housing prices based on a range of features, including crime rate, property tax rates, number of rooms, and more. This project entailed preprocessing data, selecting appropriate kernels, and tuning hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance. We aimed to provide real estate stakeholders with a tool for accurate market value assessment, which is crucial for pricing strategies, investment decisions, and policy making. Our teamâ€™s effort highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms to revolutionize predictive analytics in real estate, providing a sophisticated model that bridges data science and economic forecasting. This work stands as a testament to the power of combining machine learning techniques with domain expertise to yield valuable insights in the housing sector.
